What is AuFaitCorona?<br>
AuFaitCorona is a website for Covid-19 awareness. It also provides links to other website and applications that can help people survive this pandemic and after pandemic. <br><br>
As developers, we believe that sometimes, we don't need to make a solution to the problems that have been already solved. What we can do is to promote these solutions in order to make people aware, knowledgeable, and also alert. And that's what AuFaitCorona's goal is.
